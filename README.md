This project uses Flask, Ollama, and LangChain, so to run the app, install these into your environment using `pip`.
To access the LLMs, you have to download and open Ollama, then pull whatever language model you want (e.g. LLama3, Mistral)
Run the app by running the command `python main.py`. This will initialize the flask server for the website to run on.
